# Example voting-app-v2 project
This is based on the original [example-voting-app](https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app) from docker-examples (https://github.com/dockersamples)

modified to work on Kubernetes

![example-voting-app](../img/voting-app_600px.png)

* A front-end web app in `Python` or `ASP.NET Core` which lets you vote between two options
* A `Redis` or `NATS` queue which collects new votes
* A `.NET Core`, `Java` or `.NET Core 2.1` worker which consumes votes and stores them inâ€¦
* A `Postgres` or `TiDB` database backed by a Docker volume
* A `Node.js` or `ASP.NET Core SignalR` webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

**Run the app in Kubernetes**

Download voting-app-v2 folder it contains the yaml specifications of the Voting App's services.

First create the vote namespace
~~~sh
$ kubectl create namespace vote
~~~
Run the following command to create the deployments and services objects:
~~~sh
$ kubectl create -f voting-app-v2/
~~~
The vote interface is then available on port 31000 on each host of the cluster, the result one is available on port 31001.
