# Install Git on Windows

1. Download the latest version of [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/).
2. Once the installer has started, follow the instructions as provided in the **Git Setup** wizard screen until the installation is complete.
3. Open the windows command prompt (or **Git Bash** if you selected not to use the standard Git Windows Command Prompt during the Git installation).
4. Type `git version` to verify Git was installed.
Note: `git-scm` is a popular and recommended resource for downloading Git for Windows. The advantage of downloading Git from `git-scm` is that your download automatically starts with the latest version of Git included with the recommended command prompt, `Git Bash` . The download source is the same [Git for Windows installer](https://gitforwindows.org/) as referenced in the steps above.
